    "story": "Satan, the Demon Lord, is forced to retreat from his world to modern-day Tokyo after being defeated by the hero Emilia. Stripped of his magical powers, he adopts the human identity 'Sadao Maou' and works part-time at MgRonald's (a McDonald's parody) to survive. Meanwhile, Emilia also arrives in Tokyo as 'Emi Yusa' and must adapt to human life. The series follows their comedic struggles with mundane human problems like paying rent, dealing with noisy neighbors, and climbing the corporate ladder while slowly regaining their powers.",
